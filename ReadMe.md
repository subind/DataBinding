Branch: view_holder_pattern
===========================
Still there is a lot of boiler-plate code being used to set the views, with the help of ids in each 
individual view using which the views are accessed & set.
This can be avoided with the help of 'data & variable' tags along with binding expressions, i.e, @{}
In this case data is bound directly to the view itself in the layout file. with the help of the above mentioned expressions.
